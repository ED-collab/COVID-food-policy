# COVID-food-policy

A simple script to compare COVID cases and stringency of policy response over time, using the wonderful [COVID19 R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/COVID19/index.html). The aggregated data is provided by the [COVID-19 data hub](https://covid19datahub.io/), undertaking the ambitious work of combining all best available datasets globally.

This script is very basic, producing a 2-panel graph demonstrating covariance in cumulative number of cases from aggregated national reporting, and policy stringency index developed and maintained by the [Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, Blavatnik School of Government](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01079-). This gives a quick way to map a complex, aggregate level of policy response to the pandemic.
